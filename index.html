    <p>I am Aidan Backus, a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Brown University; previously I was at UC Berkeley. My main research interest is PDE, especially its geometric and numerical-analytic aspects, but I generally enjoy interdisciplinary parts of mathematics.</p>
    <p>I can be reached at aidan_backus@brown.edu. You might also read my <a href="professional/cv.pdf">CV</a>, <a href="http://github.com/abackus">GitHub</a>, and blog <a href="https://backus.home.blog/">Some Compact Thoughts</a>, or check out the community-written real analysis textbook, <a href="https://clopen-analysis.github.io">Clopen Analysis</a>.</p>
    <p>Recently I've been thinking about least-gradient and best-Lipschitz functions, advised by <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/gdaskalo">George Daskalopoulos</a>; see my recent <a href="research_statement.pdf">research statement</a> for more on that. I've also recently been interested in the fractal uncertainty principle and the scattering theory of resonances.</p>

  <p id="paper2" style="display:none">We propose a conjecture stating that for resonances, \lambda_j, of a noncompactly supported potential, the series \sum_j \Im \lambda_j/|\lambda_j|^2 diverges. This series appears in the Breit-Wigner approximation for a compactly supported potential, in which case it converges.

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>Here are some interesting questions, and some thoughts on how to solve them. If you have more thoughts, feel free to send me an email!</p>

<ol>
<li class="pushup"><p>A function is said to be \infty-harmoinc if it solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Laplacian">\infty-Laplace equation</a>. Equivalently, a function u is best-Lipschitz if it solves the minimax problem: choose u to minimize the maximal value of its Lipschitz seminorm (subject to homotopy class, compact perturbation, etc.), and is the limit of p-harmonic functions. It was shown by <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~savin/evans-savin.pdf">Evans and Savin</a> that best-Lipschitz functions are H&ouml;lder-continuously differentiable on the euclidean plane, and they conjecture that this is true in any dimension. Furthermore, this regularity result is best possible. <strong>Show that \infty-harmonic functions are H&ouml;lder-continuously differentiable on any Riemannian manifold.</strong></p>
<p>I think that this should not be too hard to show on Riemannian surfaces: one would need to cleverly choose coordinates in which they can carry out the anistropic rescaling and bootstrap argument of Evans and Savin. I have no idea how to get rid of the dimension hypothesis, however. Since the \infty-Laplace equation has applications in game theory, maybe one could give some clever game-theoretic argument.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Give a numerical scheme for solving the Dirichlet problem for the Riemannian \infty-Laplace equation.</strong></p>
  <p>Presumably, one would need to modify the work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.5278.pdf">Oberman</a> to account for the presence of curvature. Once one actually came up with an effective scheme, actually implementing it would be a fun research project for an undergraduate math-CS double major.</p></li>

<li><p>Since the cumulative distribution function of the middle-thirds Cantor set's natural probability measure \mu has bounded variation, we can define the <a href="https://backus.home.blog/2021/10/15/the-normal-bundle-to-the-devils-staircase-and-other-questions-that-keep-me-up-at-night/">normal bundle to the Devil's Staircase</a>. <strong>Show that almost surely, the normal vector to a \mu-randomly drawn point on the Devil's Staircase points horizontally.</strong></p>
<p>By identifying points on the Devil's staircase with points in the Cantor set, and then identifying those with paths through an infinite binary tree, we can reduce this to a problem about binary strings. If a binary string x is <q>sufficiently generic</q> (e.g. is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmically_random_sequence">algorithmically random</a>, though this assumption is probably far stronger than necessary), then this property alone should be enough to determine the direction the normal vector at the point on the Devil's Staircase coded by x points. On the other hand, one can probably use the divergence theorem to show that the mean normal vector must point horizontally. A \mu-randomly drawn point is algorithmically random almost surely, so these two facts should together imply that the normal vector points horizontally. (Some of these observations were pointed out to me by James Leng and Reuben Drogin.)</p></li>

<li><p>The cubic Schrödinger equation on the line with Dirac impurity has been studied by <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~zworski/hz3f.pdf">Holmer and Zworski</a>. To develop a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_theory">scattering theory</a> for this equation, one would need to analytically continue the resolvent R of the linearized cubic Schrödinger operator to a suitable Riemann surface, and then study the behavior of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonances_in_scattering_from_potentials">resonances</a>, that is, the poles of the analytic continuation of R. <strong>Develop a scattering theory for the cubic Schrödinger equation on the line, with compactly supported impurities.</strong></p>
<p>Algebro-geometric considerations show that the Riemann surface in question must be an open subset of the Riemann sphere, but there will be branching and so this surface is not naturally isomorphic to a subset of the complex plane. One could use the spectral-theoretic argument that appears in the appendix of a paper of <a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~rfroese/papers/1dpoles/1dpoles.pdf">Froese</a> to show that the resolvent admits an analytic continuation.</p></li>

<li><p>One can prove a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besicovitch_covering_theorem">Besicovitch covering theorem</a> which holds on Riemannian manifolds of sufficiently small diameter. The combinatorial constant, which I will call the Besicovitch number, depends on the Riemannian metric. <strong>Give an explicit formula, or at least an algorithm, to compute the Besicovitch number in terms of the norms of the Riemann curvature tensor, the diameter, and the dimension.</strong></p>
<p>One would need to generalize the arguments of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2161215">Füredi and Loeb</a>, who tackle this problem on euclidean space. (This paper was shown to me by Max Weinreich.)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Give an algorithm for computing the root multiplicities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kac%E2%80%93Moody_algebra">Kac-Moody algebras</a> of rank r whose runtime is at most exponential in r.</strong></p>
  <p>The algorithm of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04540">Connick, Lin, and myself</a> has superexponential runtime in r. Most of the runtime comes from repeated matrix operations involving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan_matrix">Cartan matrix</a>, which could be avoided if the Cartan matrix was written in a basis where it is sparse, for example diagonal. One could potentially use Galois theory to show that instead of working over the rational numbers, one could work in a clever chosen number field where the Cartan matrix admits a sparse basis. (This was pointed out to me by Joshua Lin.) However, I don't know if there are efficient matrix-multiplication algorithms over number fields.</p></li>
